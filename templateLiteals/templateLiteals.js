let age = 24;
let exp = 5;


console.log("My age is " + age + " and I have " + exp + " years of experience");
// output : My age is 24 and I have 5 years of experience


console.log(`My age is ${age} and I have ${exp} years of experience`);
// output : My age is 24 and I have 5 years of experience

// there are same mathod to print the output but the second method is more readable and easy to understand.

console.log("ro\"hit");
// output : ro"hit

console.log(`ro"hit`);
// output : ro"hit

console.log('ro"hit');
// output : ro"hit

console.log(`ro'hit`);
